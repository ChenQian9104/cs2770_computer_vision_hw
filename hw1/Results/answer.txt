The "texture_repr_mean" representation has the smallest within-between ratio. 

This is beyond my expectation since the "bow_repr" representation should actually has the gradient information within the image and can better distinguish and categroize different class. 

According to my observation, the "texture_repr_mean" has the best performance since:

1. The algorithm is easy to implement;
2. Obtain the smallest within-between ratio.
